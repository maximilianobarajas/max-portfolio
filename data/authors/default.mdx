Max Barajas is an Applied Mathematics student at the Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana (UAM) and is currently completing an academic exchange semester at Université Gustave Eiffel in France, strengthening his international academic profile. His academic interests focus on the analysis and solution of complex problems using quantitative methods, particularly in structured systems such as networks, constrained optimization models, and complex systems.

He is currently conducting research at the Center for Genomic Sciences of UNAM (CCG, UNAM), within the Computational Genomics Laboratory, where he works on the extraction and analysis of protein–protein interaction networks under the supervision of Dr. Carlos Francisco Méndez Cruz. Previously, he supported research activities at the Institute of Renewable Energies of UNAM (IER, UNAM), under the supervision of Dr. Fernando Ayala Mato. In parallel with his academic training, he has actively participated in university representation as a Divisional Councilor at UAM, contributing to collegial decision-making and academic governance.

His academic and professional development is complemented by research stays and applied projects. His undergraduate thesis at UAM, supervised by Dr. Edwin Montes Orozco, focused on swarm intelligence algorithms applied to information congestion problems in neural graph networks, linking optimization criteria with flow behavior in complex systems. He also completed a research stay in Montreal at CIRRELT, working on nonlinear modeling of the vehicle routing problem with variable temperature and food perishability, under the supervision of Dr. Hani Zbib and Dr. Maryam Darvish.

Beyond academia, he participated in an industry project at El Puerto de Liverpool titled “Try It Yourself”, involving smart mirrors placed at strategic locations to generate images of users wearing catalog clothing, enhancing the in-store user experience. He has received international mobility scholarships and academic recognitions, and was selected for the IA 1000 program by INFOTEC, through which he traveled to China (Hangzhou and Shenzhen) to study artificial intelligence.
